# Slider images

Place the three hero slider images in this folder with the following exact filenames:

- `slider-warehouse.jpg` – coffee warehouse aisle image
- `slider-kitchen.jpg` – commercial bakery kitchen image
- `slider-roaster.jpg` – coffee roaster machine image

After copying, refresh the site. If the images don’t change, hard-refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) or update the service worker by opening DevTools > Application > Service Workers > Update.
